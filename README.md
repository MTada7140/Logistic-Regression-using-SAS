# Logistic-Regression-using-SAS

In this repository I'd like to show the processes of logistc regression using SAS software. The goal of this article is to estimate regression model which best fit for sets of time data. I am going to cover importing of raw data to SAS, pre-analysis data visualisation and three steps of applying logistic regression step-by-step.
